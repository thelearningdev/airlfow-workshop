# BookOps Workshop: Airflow ETL/ELT Pipelines

Hands-on workshop scaffold for teaching Apache Airflow 3.2 through a fictional BookOps data platform.

[Slide deck (PDF)](slides/workshop-slides.pdf)

> IMPORTANT 🚨: Please complete the setup before the tutorial. We need to pull(download) docker images and install packages, let's do it faster at the comfort of our home internet.

## Setup 

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12
- Docker Desktop with at least 4 GB memory, or a local Postgres instance

### Clone this repo

```
git clone git@github.com:thelearningdev/pyconus-2026-apache-airflow-tutorial.git
```

### Airflow Environment

Goal: To get the Airflow home page after logging in

### Using Github Codespaces

If your local system doesn't allow you to install things, you can use github codespaces. Click on Code(top right) -> Codespaces -> Create new codespaces on main

![as an alternative use github codespaces](assets/images/github-codespaces.png)

If you use codespace instead of using localspace you will use something like this `https://humble-enigma-4xvq5wgx66cqppv-8080.app.github.dev/`
Replace - `humble-enigma-4xvq5wgx66cqppv` - with your unique codespace name

PORTS
- 8080 for airflow
- 5432 for postgres
- 8501 for analytics app

### Setup Local Python Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
export AIRFLOW_HOME=$PWD # important if not airflow will take your home folder for setting up airflow
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Docker Compose

We will use `docker-compose` to run our airflow system, a postgres db and an analytics app

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

If `8080` is busy:

```bash
AIRFLOW_PORT=8081 docker compose up --build
```

## Setup Check


### 1. Airflow is up and Running

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) you'll see 
> use 8081 if your 8080 is busy

![airflow login screen screenshot](assets/images/airflow-login.png)

and sign in with 


```
username: airflow
password: <find-in-file-simple_auth_manager_passwords.json.generated>
```

### 2. Airflow Shell

On a new terminal run

```
docker compose exec airflow /bin/bash
```
On the shell that opens run

---

```
airflow dags list
```
You will see a list of all the dags in the `dags/` folder

### 3. Postgres DB tables

You can use a postgres client like pgadmin or dbeaver(my favorite) or any other postgres explorer of your choice
You need to connect two db's one is for our data engineering stuff, one is used by airflow.
After connecting to the DB you should able to explore the tables like below

![dbeaver screenshot sample after connecting to the DBs](dbeaver-tables.png)


```
postgresql+psycopg://airflow:airflow@localhost:5432/airflow
postgresql://airflow:airflow@localhost:5432/bookops
```

### 4. Analytics App

1. Open [http://localhost:8501/](http://localhost:8501/) on your browser.
2. You will see `BookShop Pipeline Dashboard`
3. Don't worry about the errors, we run the pipeline to fill up this dashboard.
  

## Exercises
- [All Exercises are in exercise.md](./exercises.md)

## Notes

1. Anytime Airflow feels clumsy run `airflow db clean --tables "dag_run,task_instance,log,xcom,asset,job" --clean-before-timestamp 2026-12-12T00:00:00 --yes` where airflow is running you will have a cleaner setu.
2. If your tasks are not getting scheduled or running for any reason, restart the airflow terminal/docker container, you should be good. Since we are using standalone version, rarely everything gets mushed together
